## Introduction to the Educational Platform Project
The **Educational Platform** is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline and enhance the learning experience by leveraging the power of modern technology. This platform features a role-based structure with four distinct roles: **Admin**, **Manager**, **Teacher**, and **Student**. Each role comes with tailored permissions to ensure secure and efficient access to the platformâ€™s features.

To manage access and ensure robust security, the platform utilizes two guards: **API** and **Teacher-API**, facilitating role-specific authentication and authorization mechanisms.

The platform also incorporates a set of CRUD operations to manage various resources efficiently.
